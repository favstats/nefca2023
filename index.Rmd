## What is political microtargeting?

> a set of techniques to leverage ***individual-level data*** for the delivery of political messages to specific target groups that are expected to be more ***susceptible*** to them


What does more "susceptible" mean?

Expectation that it is more *effective*

--

Based on congruency between recipient and message:

+ **congruency** theory (Aaker 1999)

+ the main idea is:

  + people pay more attention when messages align with self-concept of receiver
  
  + when paying more attention they may have greater impact (Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Wheeler, DeMarree, and Petty 2008)
  

---

## (Some) Types of Microtargeting

+ *behavioral targeting* (Dobber et al. 2019)
  
  + e.g. people that engage with political content online
  
--
  
+ *psychographic* or *psychological targeting* (Tufekci 2014, Sharp 2018)

  + matching a person's personality (like their degree of extraversion) to the content of an ad can increase an ad's persuasive power and increase the clicks and conversions it generates (Moon 2002, Wheeler 2008)
  
  +  Nai and Maier (2020) show that uncivil attack ads are most effective in lowering perceptions of the attacked politician when the receiver of the message scores high on psychopathy
  
--

+ *issue-based targeting* (Endres 2020)

  + people who care about climate change, economy, abortion rights
  


---


### Effectiveness


+ In (field) experiments, tentative evidence suggests that microtargeted political ads are indeed effective (Dobber et al., 2020; Dobber
et al., 2023; Endres, 2020; Krotzek, 2019; Tappin et al., 2023; Zarouali et al., 2022).


+ messages about abortion rights were most **effective in increasing vote share of women in competitive congressional districts** (Haenschen, 2022)

+ Krotzek (2019) and Zarouali et al. (2022) find that political ads tailored to match personality traits **enhance positive feelings towards candidates and increase persuasiveness**

### Online Political Microtargeting

.pull-left[


![](img/online.png)

]

.pull-right[
**1. Scalability**

- Offline campaigning: limited volunteers & time

- Digital campaigns reach vast audiences quickly

<br>

**2. Accessibility**

- Microtargeting techniques available even for budget-limited campaigns

- Use of platform-provided data and own contact lists

]


---

### Not all platforms are the same for political microtargeting

.pull-left[
**Meta**  allows targeting based on:
  + detailed demographics (age, gender, education, etc.)
  + users "interests" 
  + behavioral targeting 
  + custom and lookalike audiences
  
(***Focus of this presentation***)

**Google** only allows limited targeting 
  + age, gender, location 
  + keywords for political ads
  
**Twitter** disallowed political ads in 2019
  + were brought them back recently (2023)
  + detailed targeting possible (demographics, custom and lookalike audiences)

]

--

.pull-right[
**Snapchat** offers detailed targeting 
  + demographics, custom and lookalike audiences
  + however is relatively understudied (e.g. Tanusondjaja 2023)
  

**TikTok** disallows political ads 
  + but researchers have documented its use: https://tiktok-audit.com/blog/2023/tiktok_political_ads/

## Microtargeting and Toxic Ads

![](img/toxic.png)



---

### Going Negative

.pull-left[

Negative campaigning (*going negative*) is a common strategy used by political campaigns 

  + attack opponents 
  + highlight their personal flaws (Geer 2006).
  + point out their voting records

There is a *negativity bias* in human information processing that draws more attention to negative information (Fiske, 1980; Hilbig, 2009; Rozin & Royzman, 2001)

]

.pull-right[

![](img/corbyn.png)

]



---


### Going negative may backfire

.pull-left[


+ However, negative ads can also **backfire**, i.e. ***backlash effect*** (Garramone 1984; Walter & van der Eijk, 2019)


  + generate sympathy for the target
  
  
  + reduce attitudes towards the attacker 



+ So when should campaigns "go negative"? 

  + Weighting the rewards and risks (Haselmayer 2019)

]


--

.pull-right[

<img src="img/toxicad.png" width="80%">

]


---


## Microtargeting and Toxicity

Microtargeting may lower the risk of backlash effects because:

+ Toxic messages can be targeted towards individuals who are most susceptible to them (Nai & Maier 2020)

  + also means: people likely to dislike toxicity can be excluded

+ A smaller range of individuals are affected if there were to be a backlash

*Hypotheses:*

> H1a: Microtargeted ads from political campaigns are more toxic than ads targeted at more general audiences.

> H1b: Outside groups should be less concerned about reputational hits and therefore show a smaller effect.

### Meta Ad Library (API)

.pull-left[

+ Meta Ad Library gives access to:

  + Ads about social issues, elections or politics that have run in the past seven years

  + You can get the text, run time (dates), spending, impressions (by age, gender, and location)
  
  + **NEW** since August 2023 *only in EU*: age, gender, and location targeting criteria (thank you DSA!)
  
+ In order to get access you need:

  + A **verified** Meta Developer account (i.e. you need to send in your ID to confirm identity ü§î)
  
  + The steps are outlined here: https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/
  
  + R package to access API: [`Radlibrary`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Radlibrary)

### Meta Ad Library (API) - It's not enough!

.pull-left[

**HOWEVER** Meta Ad Library has been criticized (Dommett & Power, 2023; Edelson et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2019):

+ It does not include all political ads
  
+ It includes many ads that are not political
  
+ It does not include the actual targeting criteria used (*only recently in EU and not all of them*)
  
+ Broad spending and impression boundaries make it hard to compare these metrics across accounts

## Takeaways


+ Official APIs are not dead.. 

  + but often have limited data
  
  + can be taken away at a whim
  

+ Scraping remains important

  + However: high hurdle to implement
  
  + Hopefully tools like `metatargetr` can reduce  that burden



+ `peRspective` can help with analyzing text data

  + However: important to validate for your use-case!

+ Detailed [blog post](https://www.pewresearch.org/decoded/2020/03/26/weighting-survey-data-with-the-pewmethods-r-package/) about how to use `pewmethods` for weighing

<!-- <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAI_L3TXMAA192x?format=png&name=4096x4096" width="80%" height="80%"> -->


<!-- --- -->

### Now what can we do with this (weighted) data?

We could study

+ **Voter turnout**: Ads might motivate or demotivate certain demographics from participating in the election.


+ **Shift in voting intent**: Exposure to certain ads might make voters reconsider their choice.

+ **Misinformation**: Microtargeted ads might spread misleading or false information tailored to specific demographics, influencing perceptions.


+ **Polarization**: Specific ads might increase division and animosity between groups, especially when they focus on contentious issues.


---

## Takeaways

+ Tracking studies may require weighting because of self-selection bias

  + R package `pewmethods` can help create weights
  
  
<br>

+ Who Targets Me helps create transparency around elections

  + they are very open to research
  
  + they can be approached if you would like to conduct studies with them

## Research Question

### How does the Meta ad delivery algorithm<br>influence the pricing & distribution of political ads<br>in the Netherlands?

---

class: center, middle

# Research Design

---

### Research Design

+ Algorithm audit study

+ Place the same ads targeting the same audiences (9 different ones)

--

+ Collaborate with Dutch parties to place political ads

+ Final collaboration with 3: 

  1. GroenLinks (Green party)
  2. VVD (centre-right party of PM Rutte)
  3. PvdA (social democrats)
  

--

+ Place ads before nationwide local elections on March 16th 2022
  + 1st to 7th February 2022

+ Spend 2 Euros a day on 45 ad copies

  + in total: 630 Euro per party
  
  
--
  
+ Pre-registered research design and hypotheses

---



### Dependent Variables

+ Price per 1k users reached

  + this measure is an industry standard

+ Unique users reached

  + this measure is co-linear with the price
  
---


### Ad Relevance


We theorize two different levels of (predicted) relevance:

--

1. Relevant audience for party (i.e. source of ad)

--

+ Ads from an environmentalist party more likely to be relevant for audience interested in environmentalism.

<br>

--

<ol start="2">
  <li>Relevant audience for ad content (e.g. political message)</li>
</ol>


--

+ Political message likely to be relevant for people interested in politics

---



### Hypotheses

![](img/relevant_quote.png)

[(Meta Business Help Center, 2022)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/430291176997542)


> **H1:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the cheaper is the cost** for reaching 1000 users in that audience.

> **H2:** **The more relevant** an audience is for an ad, **the more are ads delivered** to that audience.

--

We expect that ads by party with a greater share of supporters are less expensive (H3a) and reach more people (H3b)

> **H3a:** Parties with a greater share of supporters pay less for reaching 1000 users.

> **H3b:** Parties with a greater share of supporters reach more people than smaller parties.

### Targeting criteria (Sub-hypotheses for H1 & H2)


We used 9 different (paired) targeting criteria for our advertisements

.pull-left[

1. Political interests
2. Excluding political interest
  

<ol start="3">
  <li>Higher educated audience</li>
  <li>Lower educated audience</li>

## Summary


---

### Summary

Our findings do not always align with expectations.

H1: More "relevant" audiences were not always cheaper

H2: More "relevant" audiences were not always reached more

H3: Party with greatest audience did not reach more or get cheaper prices

--

**However:**

> We **still** find that Meta ad delivery algorithm prioritizes certain parties and audiences for political advertising

1. PvdA pays least and reach most
2. Lower-educated, people interested in environment, women and younger people more expensive to reach

---

### Limitations

+ Only three political parties

+ Study first-of-its-kind

  + needs more research!
  
+ Relevance might need to be measured differently?

+ We do not vary content.. although studies suggest this is important (Ali et al. 2021, 2022)


---

### Implications


+ Unequal playing field

  + Meta (dis-)advantages certain parties

  +  the findings presented in this paper show that political parties were not charged the same price for the same service
  
--

+ Potential for deepening political, social and geographical inequalities 

  + Some groups of people and regions are **systematically** less likely to receive political advertisements and more expensive to reach

  + isolating these groups from receiving election-related information

--

+ Little to no transparency by Meta about these systematic biases

  + difficult to research and make visible instances of unequal treatment and price discrimination
  + highlighting importance of access to data
  
--
  
+ Simply "banning" microtargeting would be inadequate

  + more power to the black box algorithm

<!-- ## Summary of within-party differences -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- + Some audiences **systematically more expensive** and **receive less ads** than others -->

<!--   + Lower Education, Environment interests -->

<!--   + No targeting is cheapest, reaches most -->

<!-- + Mostly **consistent for each party** -->

<!-- + Suspected *"market shock"* on February 4th affects results -->

<!--   + Some evidence that politics and economy audiences might be cheaper were it not for the spike -->
